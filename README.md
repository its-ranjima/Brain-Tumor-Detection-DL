# Brain-Tumor-Detection-DL
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model classifies whether an input image contains a brain tumor or not. The notebook includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
