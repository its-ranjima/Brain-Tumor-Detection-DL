# Brain-Tumor-Detection-DL
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model classifies whether an input image contains a brain tumor or not. The notebook includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is obtained from Kaggle [Brain Tumor Dataset,](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/brain-tumor-dataset) which consists of MRI images categorized into:
Tumor
No Tumor
